All notable changes to the BuildLang program suite.

## [Unreleased]

### qdb: WHERE Fails Closed on an Unknown Column (2026-09-05)

**A WHERE clause that named a column no table has returned a silent wrong
answer instead of an error.** A leaf condition stores its left side as a column
ref resolved at eval time, and `resolve_col` returns -1 for a name no column
matches.
- `eval_cond_row` scored that unresolved leaf as false, so `WHERE nosuchcol = 5`
  matched nothing and returned an empty result with exit 0. The IS NULL branch
  scored it true instead, so `WHERE nosuchcol IS NULL` returned every row. Both
  dropped the real intent with no diagnostic, on SELECT, aggregates, GROUP BY,
  UPDATE, DELETE, and scalar subqueries.
- One helper, `where_cols_ok`, validates every WHERE leaf column once before the
  row scan and prints `Error: no such column: <name>`. It reuses `resolve_col`,
  so a dotted `table.col` or an alias ref resolves exactly as it does during
  evaluation, and it runs independently of row count, so an empty table is
  covered too.
- Guards at six single-table entry points call it: `exec_select` (one guard
  covers both its index and full scans and the no-group aggregate path it
  calls), `exec_select_group`, `exec_update`, `exec_delete`, and
  `exec_subquery_scalar`. The five void paths return before any work; the
  subquery, which returns a String and cannot abort just itself, exits the
  statement. UPDATE and DELETE validate before mutating, so a bad column leaves
  the table untouched. The JOIN path uses a separate evaluator and is unaffected.
- Tests added: `where_unknown_select`, `where_unknown_agg`,
  `where_unknown_group`, `where_unknown_update`, `where_unknown_delete`,
  `where_unknown_isnull`, `where_unknown_dotted`, `where_unknown_subquery`. Each
  fails on the pre-fix binary and passes after the guards. The qdb gate is now
  141 pass, 0 fail, 1 XFAIL, 0 XPASS.

### qdb: WHERE Fails Closed on Arithmetic and Doubled Operators (2026-09-05)

**A WHERE condition that used an arithmetic or doubled operator returned zero
rows with exit 0 instead of an error: a silent wrong answer.** The leaf parser
built a condition even when the operator token was not a comparison.
- `op_encode` returns -1 for any token that is not one of `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`,
  `>=`, `<>`, `!=`. The parser stored that -1 in the leaf, and `eval_where`
  treats -1 as always-false, so `WHERE salary + 10 > 100` and `WHERE salary % 2
  = 0` matched nothing and dropped the real comparison with no diagnostic.
- Two guards in `parse_condition` now fail closed. The first rejects an
  operator that `op_encode` does not recognize, which covers arithmetic in a
  condition and stray symbols like `%`. The second rejects an operator token in
  the value position (token type 4), which catches the C-style `==` (two `=`
  tokens, where the second would be read as the string value `"="`) and `><`.
- A negative literal is a single number token, so `col > -5` is unaffected, and
  a quoted string that looks like an operator (`sym = '<'`) is a string token, so
  it still compares as a value.
- Tests added: `where_arith_plus_closed`, `where_arith_pct_closed`,
  `where_double_eq_closed`, `where_gtlt_closed`. Each fails on the pre-fix binary
  and passes after the guards.

### qdb: Empty-Set MIN and MAX Return SQL NULL (2026-09-05)

**An aggregate MIN or MAX over an empty result set rendered a float sentinel as
a plausible number instead of NULL: a silent wrong answer.** A non-grouped
aggregate returns one row even when the WHERE matches nothing, and MIN/MAX seed
their accumulators to `999999999` / `-999999999`.
- Over zero rows `float_to_str` rendered those seeds as `12157520.92` /
  `-12157520.92`, so `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM emp WHERE id > 999` handed back a
  number for what is really NULL.
- Fix at all three aggregate sites: when the match count is zero, MIN and MAX
  return the empty string, which renders as SQL NULL and mirrors the text path.
  COUNT stays 0; SUM and AVG stay 0 (a kept divergence from SQLite's NULL, where
  0 is a real answer).
- Tests added: `empty_min_num`, `empty_max_num` (the two controls, which fail on
  the prior binary), plus `empty_count`, `empty_sum`, `empty_avg`.

### qdb: MIN and MAX on a TEXT Column Order Lexicographically (2026-09-05)

**MIN and MAX on a TEXT column returned 0 instead of the extreme string: a
silent wrong answer.** Every cell went through `parse_float`, which coerces text
like `alice` to 0.0, so with the numeric sentinels every text extreme collapsed
to 0.
- Fix at all three aggregate sites: read the column type code and, for TEXT,
  track the extreme cell through `compare_vals` (which already orders TEXT
  lexicographically) and return that string. The numeric path is unchanged; SUM
  and AVG on text stay 0, matching SQLite coercion of non-numeric text.
- Tests added: `min_name`, `max_name`, `min_dept`, `max_dept`,
  `group_min_name`, `group_max_name`, `subq_min_name`, `subq_max_name`, plus
  `max_salary` as a numeric-path guard.

### qdb: JOIN and UNION ORDER BY Resolve Ordinals and Fail Closed (2026-09-05)

**The JOIN and UNION sort paths now resolve a positional ordinal and fail closed
on an unknown key, matching the single-table path.** This closes the follow-up
the entry below left open.
- The single-table ORDER BY was already fail-closed and ordinal-aware, but the
  JOIN and UNION sort paths still resolved a key only by name and silently
  returned scan order for an ordinal (`ORDER BY 1`), an out-of-range position, or
  an unknown name. A union has no other portable key: only the first branch's
  column names reach the merged headers, so `ORDER BY 2` was the intended way to
  order it and it did nothing.
- UNION: a new helper, `resolve_union_order_key`, maps the key to an output-column
  position. A bare integer is a 1-based ordinal into the merged columns; anything
  else matches a merged header name (which reflects a first-branch `AS` alias).
  Both the primary and the secondary key route through it, and a position outside
  `1..ncol` or an unmatched name fails closed.
- JOIN: the resolution preamble now takes an ordinal as the Nth projected column
  and maps it back to whichever source table owns that column, reusing the
  existing `sel_table`/`sel_col` projection arrays, so ordinal ordering shares the
  named-key path's numeric comparison, stable tie-break, and LEFT JOIN
  null-extension. A name still resolves against either joined table.
- Honest carve-out: a JOIN ORDER BY resolves a source-table column name or an
  ordinal, but not a projection alias (`... AS k ... ORDER BY k`), which fails
  closed rather than sorting by an unselected column. Single-table and UNION
  selects do resolve an alias. This is safe (fail-closed, never a wrong order) and
  is documented as a known limitation, not silently ignored.
- Both read-only paths (`exec_select_join` is `~ Console`, no Process effect) fail
  closed with an error message and a bare return that leaves the table intact,
  rather than a process exit, so the effect signatures are unchanged.
- Tests added: `join_order_ordinal_left`, `join_order_ordinal_sec`,
  `union_order_ordinal_desc`, `union_order_ordinal_two`, `union_order_ordinal_name`,
  and four fail-closed cases (`join_order_ordinal_oor_closed`,
  `join_order_unknown_closed`, `union_order_ordinal_oor_closed`,
  `union_order_unknown_closed`).
- db.bld: 5,946 lines. Gate: pass=115 fail=0 xfail=1 xpass=0 (the one XFAIL is
  cross-process ROLLBACK, a documented process-model null).

### qdb: ORDER BY Resolves Ordinals and Aliases, Fails Closed on Unknown Keys (2026-09-05)

**The non-grouped single-table ORDER BY now resolves a positional ordinal and a
projection alias, and fails closed when a key names no column.**
- The plain SELECT sort path resolved the ORDER BY key only against real table
  columns. A key that did not match, a positional ordinal (`ORDER BY 2`, standard
  SQL-92), an unknown name (`ORDER BY nonesuch`), or a projection alias on a plain
  select (`SELECT salary AS s ... ORDER BY s`), silently returned discovery order
  with no error. A secondary tie-break key (`ORDER BY dept, s`) failed the same
  silent way. The grouped path already failed closed on an unresolved key; the
  non-grouped path did not, so the two disagreed.
- A single helper, `resolve_order_key`, now maps a key to a table column index by
  three forms: a column name (bare or dotted), a positional ordinal (the Nth
  select column, or the Nth table column under `SELECT *`), and a projection
  alias whose underlying select item is a plain column. Both the primary and the
  secondary key route through it, and an unresolved key prints an error and exits
  non-zero instead of leaving the rows in discovery order.
- An ordinal or alias that points at an aggregate select item does not resolve on
  this path (it never sorts by an aggregate value), so such a key fails closed.
- Tests added: `order_ordinal_proj`, `order_alias_plain`, `order_secondary_ord`,
  `order_secondary_alias`, `order_ordinal_star`, and four fail-closed cases
  (`order_unknown_closed`, `order_ordinal_oor_closed`, `order_ordinal_zero_closed`,
  `order_secondary_closed`).
- Scope: the JOIN and UNION sort paths still ignore an ordinal or unknown key the
  same silent way. They resolve differently (two tables for a join, output-column
  position for a union) and are left as separate follow-ups, not folded in here.
- db.bld: 5,892 lines. Gate: pass=106 fail=0 xfail=1 xpass=0 (the one XFAIL is
  cross-process ROLLBACK, a documented process-model null).

### qdb: Numeric Type Aliases Sort Numerically (2026-09-05)

**A column declared with a common SQL integer or real alias now orders and
right-aligns as a number, matching INTEGER/REAL.**
- The engine recognized only the exact tokens `INTEGER` and `REAL` as numeric.
  Every other spelling (`INT`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `TINYINT`, `MEDIUMINT`,
  `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `NUMERIC`, `DECIMAL`) fell through to the TEXT storage code,
  so a column such as `salary INT` compared lexicographically. `ORDER BY salary
  DESC` returned `90, 80, 70, 120, 100` instead of `120, 100, 90, 80, 70`: a
  silent wrong answer, plus left-justified output for what is really a number.
- A single classifier, `type_code_for(type_up)`, now maps a declared type name to
  its storage code (0 INTEGER, 1 REAL, 2 TEXT) and recognizes the aliases. It
  replaces the three inline `INTEGER`/`REAL` checks at the schema-load, CREATE
  TABLE, and ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN sites, so all three agree by construction.
- WHERE was already correct: `eval_where` auto-detects a numeric operand at
  comparison time regardless of the declared type, so the blast radius was
  ORDER BY and column alignment only.
- Tests added: `alias_int_order_desc`, `alias_int_order_asc`,
  `alias_bigint_order_asc`, `alias_float_order_desc`.
- db.bld: 5,832 lines. Gate: pass=97 fail=0 xfail=1 xpass=0 (the one XFAIL is
  cross-process ROLLBACK, a documented process-model null).

**README reconciled.** The qdb line count was corrected to 5,832 in both the
program table and the section prose (the table row still read 4,940 and the prose
5,705), and a SQL-support bullet now records that integer and real type aliases
are recognized.

### qdb: COUNT(DISTINCT col) + Fail-Closed DISTINCT Guards (2026-09-05)

**COUNT(DISTINCT col) now counts distinct non-NULL values, grouped and non-grouped.**
- `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dept) FROM emp` and
  `SELECT dept, COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM emp GROUP BY dept` previously had no
  path: the parser accepted only a bare column or `*` inside an aggregate, so
  DISTINCT was a syntax error. A fourth per-projection array, `p_agg_distinct`,
  now runs parallel to `p_agg_funcs`/`p_agg_cols`/`p_aliases` and carries a
  1 for `COUNT(DISTINCT col)`. Both the non-grouped path (`compute_single_agg`)
  and the grouped path (a new `group_count_col_distinct`) linear-scan the match
  set and dedup by pooled string value before counting.
- The distinct count is proven independent of the row count by a test that
  inserts a duplicate salary within a group, so distinct (2) diverges from the
  group's row count (3).
- The output header renders `COUNT(DISTINCT col)`; a projection alias still
  overrides it, and grouped ORDER BY resolves against that alias.
- DISTINCT outside COUNT fails closed: `SUM(DISTINCT ...)`/`AVG(DISTINCT ...)`
  report "DISTINCT is only supported inside COUNT" and `COUNT(DISTINCT *)`
  reports "COUNT(DISTINCT *) is not supported; use COUNT(*)", both via
  process_exit(1) with the table left intact, rather than silently dropping the
  keyword.
- Tests added: `count_distinct_dept_nogroup`, `count_distinct_grouped`,
  `count_distinct_alias_order`, `count_distinct_sum_closed`,
  `count_distinct_star_closed`.
- db.bld: 5,810 lines. Gate: pass=93 fail=0 xfail=1 xpass=0 (the one XFAIL is
  cross-process ROLLBACK, a documented process-model null).

**README reconciled.** The aggregate list now includes COUNT(DISTINCT col), a
known-limitation note records that DISTINCT is COUNT-only with the other forms
failing closed, and a stale Known-Issue claiming grouped ORDER BY sorts by the
group column only (already false since the prior entry) was removed.

### qdb: Grouped ORDER BY by Alias + Fail-Closed Resolution (2026-09-05)

**Grouped ORDER BY now resolves a projection alias.**
- `SELECT dept, SUM(salary) AS s FROM emp GROUP BY dept ORDER BY s DESC`
  previously left rows in group-discovery order (a silent wrong answer). The
  grouped-sort path in `exec_select_group` now resolves the order key in two
  steps: an aggregate/plain match by func + arg, then a projection-alias match
  against `p_aliases`. The sort type is derived from the matched output column,
  not the parsed key.
- An order key that matches none of the grouped column, an aggregate output, or
  a select alias now fails closed with an error instead of emitting rows in
  arbitrary order.
- Tests added: `group_ord_alias_sum_desc`, `group_ord_alias_sum_asc`,
  `group_ord_alias_cnt_desc`, `group_ord_unresolved_closed`.
- db.bld: 5,705 lines. Gate: pass=88 fail=0 xfail=1 xpass=0 (the one XFAIL is
  cross-process ROLLBACK, a documented process-model null).

**README reconciled to the current engine.** The qdb section now documents
capabilities the engine already shipped: INNER/LEFT JOIN, UNION and UNION ALL,
and the boolean-expression-tree WHERE parser (parenthesized grouping and NOT
BETWEEN evaluate exactly, no longer flat DNF). Removed the stale limitation
claiming grouped ORDER BY on an aggregate term leaves rows unsorted, and
narrowed the XFAIL-divergence note to cross-process ROLLBACK only.

### Documentation Site + Build Scripts (2026-03-27)

**GitHub Pages site created (docs/index.html):**
- Single-page documentation at harperz9.github.io/build-universe
- Stats, code examples, program table, architecture overview, quality badges
- All numbers verified from actual source (30,132 lines, 62 programs, etc.)
- Enable in repo Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch `main`, folder `/docs`

**Build scripts created:**
- `build_all.bat` - compile all programs via buildc + MSVC (run from cmd.exe)
- `build_all_self.bat` - compile all via self-hosted qcodegen + MSVC

### Closure Codegen + In-Process Benchmarks (2026-03-27)

**Closure/lambda codegen - THE LAST MAJOR GAP CLOSED:**
- `|x| x * 2` emits static C function `__lambda_N`
- `.map(|x| expr)` desugars to C for-loop with qv_push
- `.filter(|x| expr)` desugars to conditional qv_push
- `.fold(init, |acc, x| expr)` desugars to accumulator loop
- `fn(T) -> T` types emit C typedef function pointers
- codegen.bld: 2,294 → 2,490 lines (+196)

**All major codegen features now implemented:**
Functions, let, if (ternary + blocks), while, return, structs, impl methods,
Vec, include!(), 30+ builtins, closures, iterator desugaring, self-compilation.

**In-process qdb benchmark:**
- REPL mode: 1,006 statements in ~12,000ms = 11ms/statement
- Per-process mode: 49ms/query (dominated by startup)
- REPL eliminates 75% of per-query overhead

### Multi-Statement If-Blocks + Full Audit (2026-03-27)

**If-expression blocks with let bindings - FIXED:**
- Single-expression branches: still emit compact C ternary
- Multi-statement branches: emit `if (cond) { stmts; target = last; } else { ... }`
- 5 new functions: is_multi_stmt_block, if_has_multi_stmt, codegen_if_block_assign,
  codegen_if_branch_body, infer_if_block_type
- codegen.bld: 2,081 → 2,294 lines (+213)

**Full re-audit: 62/62 programs produce structurally valid C**
- All have `#include`, `int main`, >20 lines
- 0 programs fail codegen
- Largest: db (4,579 lines C), codegen (3,565), qc (3,258)

### include!() Preprocessing + Builtins + Self-Compilation (2026-03-27)

**include!() preprocessing added to qcodegen:**
- Scans source for `include!("path")`, reads referenced files, splices inline
- Double-inclusion guard (pipe-delimited path tracking)
- Path resolution relative to source file directory
- All 16 stdlib-using programs now generate correct C
- **Self-compilation works:** qcodegen processes its own source (2,081 lines)
  including `include!("stdlib/chars.bld")` and `include!("stdlib/tokenizer.bld")`
  → produces 3,352 lines of C

**15 missing builtins mapped:**
- Functions: time_unix, clock_ms, getenv, to_string_i32, to_string_f64
- String methods: ends_with, trim, split, split_whitespace, parse_float,
  compare, to_lowercase, to_uppercase, replace
- Runtime helpers added: qc_itoa, qc_ftoa, qc_clock_ms, qc_ends_with,
  qc_trim, qc_to_lower, qc_to_upper, qc_replace

**getenv return type fixed:** now inferred as `const char*` (was `int64_t`)

codegen.bld: 1,835 → 2,081 lines (+246)

### Impl Method Dispatch + E2E Audit (2026-03-27)

**Impl/method dispatch added to qcodegen:**
- `impl Type { fn method(&self) }` → `Type_method(Type* self)` (mangled names)
- `self.field` → `self->field` (pointer deref inside methods)
- `obj.method(args)` → `Type_method(&obj, args)` (dispatch with address-of)
- `Type::new(...)` recognized as constructor returning `Type`
- codegen.bld: 1,594 → 1,835 lines (+241 lines for impl support)

**End-to-end audit (qcodegen → MSVC → run):**
- Previously proven: 6 programs (test_hello, yes, echo, basename, dirname, seq)
- New proven: tee, + 2 impl test programs = **9 programs total**
- Remaining gaps: include!() not preprocessed by qcodegen, if-expression blocks
  with let bindings, missing builtin mappings (time_unix, split, split_whitespace)

### Self-Hosted Compiler: 62/62 Programs Compile (2026-03-27)

**qcodegen now compiles ALL 62 programs to C.**
- Added Vec codegen: `vec![]` → `qv_new()`, `vec_push`/`vec_get`/`vec_len` → `qv_push`/`qv_get`/`qv_len` with embedded QVec runtime
- Fixed ternary type inference for string branches
- codegen.bld: 1,517 → 1,594 lines

**Audit results:**
- 62/62 programs produce valid C output
- Largest: db.bld → 4,429 lines of C
- Self-compilation: codegen.bld → 1,773 lines C, qc.bld → 2,228 lines C
- Smallest: test_hello → 36 lines C

**Note:** "compiles to C" means syntactically valid C is generated. Some programs
may have runtime issues (wrong types, missing methods) that prevent the C from
compiling with gcc/MSVC. The proven end-to-end programs (C compiles AND runs
correctly) are: test_hello, yes, echo, basename, dirname, seq, + struct test.

### Struct Codegen in Self-Hosted Compiler (2026-03-27)

**qcodegen now handles structs:**
- Struct typedef emission: `struct Point { x: i64 }` → `typedef struct { int64_t x; } Point;`
- Struct literal construction: `Point { x: 3 }` → `(Point){ .x = 3 }`
- Field access: `p.x` → `p.x`
- Field assignment: `q.x = 10` → `q.x = 10`
- Struct parameters in functions: `fn foo(p: Point)` → `int64_t foo(Point p)`

**New programs compilable by self-hosted compiler:**
- basename.bld (232 lines C), dirname.bld (235), seq.bld (349)
- Any program using simple structs now works

**Programs proven end-to-end with qcodegen: 6**
(test_hello, yes, echo, + struct test, basename, dirname)

**4 more programs migrated to stdlib/lines.bld:**
- awk (-18), sed (-13), cut (-12), paste (-30) = **-73 lines**

### Self-Hosted Compiler Proven End-to-End (2026-03-27)

**qcodegen compiles real programs to working native binaries:**
- `yes.bld` (81 lines) → 156 lines of C → compiles → runs correctly
  (tested: `yes -n 5`, `yes hello -n 3`, `yes --help`)
- `echo.bld` (131 lines) → 195 lines of C → compiles → runs correctly
  (tested: `echo hello world`, `echo -n hello`, `echo --help`)
- `test_hello.bld` → compiles → `3628800`, `5050` (correct)

**7 codegen fixes applied:**
1. Variable type tracking (string vs int for correct format specifiers)
2. Builtin function translation (args_count→argc, args_get→argv[i])
3. String method translation (.starts_with, .len, .substring, .parse_int, etc.)
4. String comparison (== → strcmp)
5. Format specifier detection (%s for strings, %lld for ints)
6. String concatenation (+ → qc_strcat)
7. Embedded C runtime with all qc_* helpers

**Remaining codegen gaps (honest):**
- Structs, if-expressions, Vec, trait methods not yet handled
- Programs using these features still need the Rust compiler

**2 more programs migrated to stdlib/lines.bld:**
- grep.bld (-16 lines), rev.bld (-15 lines)
- sort, uniq, wc couldn't migrate (architecture mismatch, already clean)

**Artifact cleanup:**
- Removed stale .bat build scripts
- Added 3 while-loop test programs to git
- Updated .gitignore for generated .c files
- Working tree: zero dirty files

### Principal-Grade Polish (2026-03-27)

**Compiler DESIGN.md (436 lines):**
- Full pipeline documentation: preprocessor → lexer → parser → type checker → MIR → backends
- Every module described with verified line counts
- Internal architecture: two-pass type checking, SSA basic blocks, closure capture,
  generic monomorphization, iterator desugaring, vtable generation
- Key design decisions with rationale (why MIR, why C backend, why flat structs)
- Complete source file index

**qdb benchmark suite:**
- `benchmarks/bench_qdb.sh`: INSERT (100/1000 rows), SELECT, WHERE, COUNT,
  ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN - all timed
- Results: 34-87ms per query on 1,000 rows (dominated by process startup)
- Honest documentation of limitations (no in-process mode, per-invocation overhead)

**numpy warnings - FIXED:**
- build-color: 13 RuntimeWarnings → 0 (np.errstate wraps in gamut.py,
  spaces.py, tonemap.py)
- 457 tests pass with zero warnings

**5 more programs migrated to stdlib/lines.bld:**
- expand (-6), unexpand (-6), fold (-6), nl (-10), tac (-77)
- Total: 105 lines removed
- tac.bld: eliminated entire Tac struct, replaced with lr_new/lr_get

### Shared Tokenizer Extraction - Major Deduplication (2026-03-27)

**stdlib/tokenizer.bld created (430 lines):**
- All 48 TK_* token type constants
- Tok struct, tok_new constructor
- Full tokenizer: tokenize(), read_string(), read_number(), read_ident_or_keyword()
- Token access: tok_text(), tok_emit(), peek_tok(), advance_tok()
- Helper functions: is_keyword(), skip_whitespace(), skip_line_comment()

**Self-hosting tools migrated (2,118 lines eliminated):**

| File | Before | After | Saved |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| tok.bld | 916 | 289 | 627 |
| parse.bld | 1,420 | 1,050 | 370 |
| check.bld | 1,990 | 1,628 | 362 |
| codegen.bld | 1,470 | 1,093 | 377 |
| qc.bld | 2,280 | 1,898 | 382 |
| **Total** | **8,076** | **5,958** | **2,118** |

**String pool migration - partially blocked:**
- csv2json, paste, patch annotated with stdlib pattern reference
- Cannot directly include stdlib/string_pool.bld due to function name
  collisions (each program's sp_add takes a different struct type)
- Blocked by: compiler lacks function overloading or module-scoped names
- Documented in program comments for future migration

### Stdlib Migration - First Real Deduplication (2026-03-27)

**Self-hosting tools migrated to shared stdlib:**
- tok.bld: -60 lines (is_alpha/is_digit/etc. replaced with include)
- parse.bld: -45 lines
- check.bld: -45 lines
- codegen.bld: -45 lines
- qc.bld: -45 lines
- Total: **240 lines of duplication eliminated** from 5 files
- Each file now starts with `include!("stdlib/chars.bld");`

**Stdlib expanded (3 new modules):**
- `stdlib/lines.bld` - LineReader struct (lr_new, lr_get) for splitting
  strings into lines. Used by 35+ programs.
- `stdlib/string_pool.bld` - StringPool struct (sp_new, sp_add, sp_get)
  for storing string arrays with Vec<i32>. Used by 10+ programs.
- `stdlib/chars.bld` - added is_bin_digit, is_oct_digit (needed by tokenizers)

**Stdlib inventory:**
```
stdlib/chars.bld        - is_digit, is_alpha, is_alnum, is_whitespace,
                             is_hex_digit, is_bin_digit, is_oct_digit
stdlib/string_utils.bld - trim_left, starts_with_alpha
stdlib/lines.bld        - LineReader (split string into lines)
stdlib/string_pool.bld  - StringPool (string array via Vec<i32>)
```

### Multi-File Includes + Refactoring (2026-03-27)

**`include!("path")` preprocessor - NEW COMPILER FEATURE:**
- Textual file inclusion: `include!("stdlib/chars.bld");` splices referenced
  file contents at the directive site, like C's `#include`
- Double-inclusion guard: each file included at most once (canonical path tracking)
- Recursion depth limit: 10 levels max with clear error on overflow
- Error on missing files: prints resolved path, exits with code 1
- Wired into all 6 compiler commands (lex, parse, check, build, run, compile)
- Unblocks: stdlib extraction, eliminating 4,000 lines of duplicated code

**Standard library started:**
- `stdlib/chars.bld` - `is_digit`, `is_alpha`, `is_alnum`, `is_whitespace`, `is_hex_digit`
- `stdlib/string_utils.bld` - `trim_left`, `starts_with_alpha` (includes chars.bld)
- Both verified: compiles, correct output, nested inclusion works

**Setter workaround removal:**
- Refactored awk.bld (-3 lines), make.bld (-14 lines), sed.bld (-13 lines)
- Removed 7 trivial setter functions, replaced with direct `s.field = value;`
- Total: 30 lines removed. Proves the struct field fix has real impact.
- All 96 program tests pass after refactoring.

### Compiler Bug Fixes (2026-03-27)

**Struct field assignment on local variables - FIXED:**
- Root cause: `lower_assign()` only handled field assignment through pointers
  (`obj->field = val`), not on local struct values (`obj.field = val`).
  Assignments on locals were silently dropped - no MIR instruction emitted.
- Fix: Added `MirStmtKind::FieldAssign` to IR, builder, lowerer, and all 7
  backends (C, LLVM, WASM, SPIRV, ARM64, x86_64). C backend now emits
  `base.field = value;` for locals.
- Impact: Eliminates the `&mut` workaround pattern from ALL 60 programs.
  Programs can now assign struct fields directly in any function scope.
- Test: `125_local_struct_assign.bld` - verifies `p.x = 10;` emits correctly.

**String literal method calls - VERIFIED WORKING:**
- Previously reported as broken (`let s = ""; s.char_at(0)` fails).
- After investigation: compiles correctly in isolation. The issue occurs only
  when mixing string literal returns with parameter method calls in the same
  function - a specific codegen edge case, not a general type inference bug.
- Status: Documented as edge-case workaround, not a blocking issue.

**Sequential while-loop codegen - VERIFIED FIXED:**
- Previously reported as dropped second while loop.
- The var_map save/restore fix (applied earlier) resolved this completely.
- Verified: 3 sequential while loops generate correct C with proper basic blocks.

### Quality Overhaul (2026-03-27)

**Documentation:**
- Added `README.md` (192 lines) - architecture decisions, full program table,
  self-hosting chain, qdb feature set, build instructions, known issues
- Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` (176 lines) - qdb module map, data model, file format
  spec, WAL protocol, query execution flow, design tradeoffs
- Added section banners and function documentation to db.bld (15+ functions)

**Testing:**
- Added `tests/run_tests.sh` - automated test suite
- 96 tests pass, 0 failures, 8 skips (interactive/system-dependent programs)
- Coverage: 49 of 57 executables tested

**Consistency Fixes:**
- Fixed qjq hanging on no input (added stdin_is_pipe check)
- Added `--help` to qdb, qjq, qsql (was missing - now 100% coverage)
- All 60 programs respond to `--help` or `-h`

**Code Organization:**
- db.bld reorganized into 12 labeled sections with architecture comments
- No logic changes - pure documentation and structural clarity

### Compiler Cleanup (2026-03-26)

- Reduced compiler warnings from 2,031 to 0
- Split lower.rs (7,967 lines) into 4 modules:
  - `mod.rs` (1,609) - struct, constructors, item lowering
  - `expr.rs` (3,627) - expression and statement lowering
  - `types.rs` (777) - type lowering, const eval
  - `macros.rs` (2,028) - closures, builtins, iterators
- Added `programs/.gitignore` for build artifacts (*.c, *.exe, *.obj)
- Removed stale `db.exe` duplicate and misnamed `qdiff` C file
- Removed stray `claude-mastery-project.conf` from calibrate-pro and aurora

## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Critical (blocking portfolio quality)
1. **No inter-program code reuse** - tokenizer duplicated across 5 self-hosting
   tools (~4,000 lines). Blocked by: compiler lacks multi-file compilation.
   Intended fix: add `use` import support to buildc.

### Significant
2. **Struct field assignment on locals** - compiler codegen bug. Programs work
   around it with `&mut` reference parameters. Fix requires C backend changes.
3. **String type inference** - `let x = ""` infers `&'static str`, blocking
   method calls. Workaround: use `str.substring(0, 0)` instead of `""`.
4. **Sequential while-loop codegen** - second while loop in same scope can be
   silently dropped. Workaround: use single-loop patterns or separate functions.
5. **Vec<String> incomplete** - only Vec<i32>/Vec<f64> have full codegen.
   Programs use string pool pattern instead.

### Minor
6. **GROUP BY rendering** - some aggregate combinations produce incorrect values
7. **qc subset** - self-hosted compiler handles simple programs only
8. **13 numpy warnings** in build-color (harmless edge cases)
9. **8 compiler integration tests skipped** (not blocking, test infra issue)
